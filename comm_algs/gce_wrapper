"""gce_wrapper.

  Runs the Greedy Clique Expansion method of community detection.
  Reads in network data as an edgelist piped in through STDIN. Writes out community
  assignments to STDOUT.  The output format maps each node to a list of communities,
  as follows:
     node1_id     comm1_id comm2_id ...
     node2_id     comm2_id ...
     ...
  where the node_ids are separated from the list of assigned communities by a tab, and
  the various communities to which a node is assigned are separated by spaces.
  
  Writes a list of communities to STDOUT, with one community per line.

Usage:
  gce_wrapper [--alpha=<a>] [--min_cliq=<m>] [--eta=<e>] [--phi=<p>]

Options:
  --alpha=<a>     Sets the resolution parameter alpha. Larger values lead to smaller
                  communities, smaller values lead to larger communities.  Values between
                  0.8 and 1.5 may be useful [default: 1.0].
  --eta=<e>       Eta is the minimum value for one seed
                  to overlap with another seed before it is considered
                  sufficiently overlapping to be discarded. 1 is complete
                  overlap; smaller values may be used to prune seeds more
                  aggressively [default: 0.5].
  --phi=<p>       Phi is the proportion of nodes within a core clique
                  that must have already been covered by other cliques, for the
                  clique to be 'sufficiently covered' in the Clique Coveage Heuristic
                  [default: 0.65].
  --min_cliq=<m>  The minimum size a clique must have to be used as a seed. Recommend 4 as
                  default, unless particularly small communities are desired (then use 3)
                  [default: 4]
  -h --help       Show this help message.
